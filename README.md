# Algorithms and Data Structures
A compendium of algorithms and data structures I've learned while following the ALGSTD12 course at my university, serving as a personal reference for studying.
I will first write all the implementations in Python as that is what I am most familiar with, then I'll rewrite everything in C++ while learning that language.
